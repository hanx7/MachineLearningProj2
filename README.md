# MachineLearningProj2

#### Goal of the project

The goal of this Project is to build and critically analyse some supervised Machine Learning methods, to predict star ratings (1, 3, or 5) for reviews on restaurants. 

#### How to run

Unzip the file named "MachineLearningProj2" ï¼Œopen the folder named "proc", using JupyterNotebook to open the python file named "proj2.ipynb"

In JupyterNotebook, Click the button Kernal ,select  "Restart and run all".

Make sure that tensorflow==1.14 has been installed in JupyterNotebook.

#### Where to find the results

The prediction results of four models are saved in "predictions_lstm.txt","predictions_svm.txt","predictions_gnb.txt","predictions_knn.txt" respectively.

Those txt files are stored in the folder namded "proc".
